<h3>Secret (taiwanese movie)</h3>

<p>I watched this movie when I was 6th grade for the first time. <br>
    My teacher often showed us the movie she liked and I think her taste on the movie were very similar to mine
</p>
<h3>About time</h3>
<p>How can I not rank this movie as my top movie of all time!<br>
    I just love how lovely the couple is in this movie and always
    wanted to have a marriage life like them. This movie tells you
    who you should get marry.

<h3>The day after tomorrow</h3>
<p>This movie was my first disaster movie I have watched.<br>
Ever since this movie, I fell in love with the disaster movies. 
I wished we as human being to be more conscious about the environmental
issues we will face in near future.
